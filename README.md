Minimalistic and clean images containing the MeteorJS platform.

Ideal for:
- Basic images for building your tools.
- Images for automatic testing and building of applications in CI.

## Images for build

Images that have in tag `build` are extended images.
In addition to the installed MeteorJS platform, an installed package `build-essential` is offered, which facilitates the assembly of applications.
